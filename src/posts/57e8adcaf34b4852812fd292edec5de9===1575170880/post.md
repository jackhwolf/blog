About me
========

My name is Jack Wolf, and I'm a junior at UW-Madison studying computer science. I'm especially interested in data science and backend web development. I really enjoy programming, and wanted to make this site both as a challenge to myself and to share/teach some of the coding things I love to do.

This blog will be mostly in Python3, as that's by far my favorite language, but will also probably include some ReactJS for frontend stuff. You'll see a lot of tutorials on things like Flask, AWS, PyTorch, and other popular Python tools. 

At UW, I've been a member of the [Wisconsin Institute for Discovery](https://wid.wisc.edu/) (AKA Wisco Disco) under [Dr. Robert Nowak](https://nowak.ece.wisc.edu/) for the past 2 years. In the lab I get to work on projects ranging from applied ML to new techniques in deep learning theory. I spent my sophomore summer in [The Wall Lab](https://wall-lab.stanford.edu/) at Stanford University with [Dr. Dennis Wall](https://wall-lab.stanford.edu/people/current/dennis/) where I worked on mobile development for the Autism Glass project, and have another deep learning related project to complete this year. This summer, I'll be a SWE intern at Capital One in DC. 


Outside of coding, I love dogs and the ocean, and go home to the SF Bay Area whenever I can.

Hope you enjoy,
